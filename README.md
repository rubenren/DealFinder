# DealFinder
webscraper that notifies when a deal is active

Things to research:
1. How to notify a user via text or mobile notification X
2. How to make it a webapp to arbitrarily add web links for deal tracking
3. Understand how to enable login info if needed for personal use (checking class availability or test availability)  X
4. What languages to use for these use cases  X
5. What is considered an MVP for my case?
 - For my use case I just need it to signal when a date is available on a calendar behind a specific login page
